Problem
Trust in inter-coop trade is manual and brittle. Disputes and reconciliation are costly.

Why integrity first
By making integrity primitives default (signatures, audit chains, checkpoints), we reduce ambiguity and speed agreement.

How it works
- Ed25519 signed writes over canonical JSON
- Append-only audit chain with deterministic hashes
- Daily Merkle checkpoints for receipts
- Simple, explainable trust scoring with factor breakdown

What it enables today
- Verifiable invoices and attestations
- Lightweight trust signals across orgs
- Deterministic demos and repeatable test runs

Interop next
- CSV import/export, adapters for QuickBooks and others

Call to pilot
Run `make demo-up` and explore. Looking for 3 pilot co-ops to co-design.
